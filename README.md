Project #1
Advanced AB-tests Simulator by Karpov.Courses

This repository contains solutions to tasks from the Advanced AB-tests Simulator course by Karpov.Courses. Through these tasks, I have been building the analytical foundation for an A/B testing platform, gradually exploring various aspects of the testing process. Each solution encompasses the development of a specific feature of the testing platform, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of A/B testing methodologies and techniques.
