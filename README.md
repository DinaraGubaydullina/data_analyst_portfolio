# Dinara Gubaydullina - Data analyst portfolio
## About me
Hi, I'm Dinara! I'm a data analyst with an analytical background in the e-commerce department of the bank. I have a Bachelor's degree in Economics (Accounting, Analysis and Audit) and later retrained and got a qualification of a Data analyst.

Here you'll find projects from my studies and personal explorations into data analysis. 

This portfolio is still work in progress.

## Study courses projects
[Advanced AB-tests Simulator by Karpov.Courses](https://github.com/DinaraGubaydullina/data_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/Advanced_AB-tests_Simulator)

This folder contains solutions to tasks from the Advanced AB-tests Simulator course by Karpov.Courses. Through these tasks, I have been building the analytical foundation for an A/B testing platform, gradually exploring various aspects of the testing process. Each solution encompasses the development of a specific feature of the testing platform, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of A/B testing methodologies and techniques.

### Skypro projects 
Skypro is an online school where I got my first insights into Data analysis at the beginning of 2022.

Here are some projects and business cases I did throughout the course.

## Other projects

[Alerting system in e-commerce](https://github.com/DinaraGubaydullina/data_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/ecom_alerting)

This folder contains scripts that can be used to send alerts to the e-commerce team if there are any deviations in visits or leads numbers by traffic type or URL. Data is taken from SQL tables (MySQL or Clickhouse dialects) and then processed and sent as an alert (using Python).

[AB-tests calculator](https://github.com/DinaraGubaydullina/data_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/AB-tests_calculator)

This folder contains a simple calculator I wrote for myself in Python to design and summarise AB tests. It includes sample size, p-value and test duration calculations based on metrics such as conversion rate.

[Titanic](https://github.com/DinaraGubaydullina/data_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/Titanic)

This folder contains my work with the famous Titanic dataset. Using Python, I did some exploratory data analysis with visualization, worked with missing data and made feature extraction for the Logistic regression model.
