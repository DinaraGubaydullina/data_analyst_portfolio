### My portfolio
Here you'll find projects from my studies and personal explorations into data analysis. Each entry showcases my journey mastering data analytics skills.

**Project #1**

This folder contains solutions to tasks from the Advanced AB-tests Simulator course by Karpov.Courses. Through these tasks, I have been building the analytical foundation for an A/B testing platform, gradually exploring various aspects of the testing process. Each solution encompasses the development of a specific feature of the testing platform, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of A/B testing methodologies and techniques.

This folder contains a simple calculator I wrote for myself to design and summarise AB tests. It includes sample size, p-value and test duration calculations based on metrics such as conversion rate.

**Project #3**
[Alerting system in e-commerce] (https://github.com/DinaraGubaydullina/data_analyst_portfolio/tree/main/ecom_alerting)

This folder contains scripts that can be used to send alerts to the e-commerce team if there are any deviations in visits or leads numbers by traffic type or URL.
